Hi, my name is Fermin Gomez! I'm a proud Latino currently studying Computer Information Systems at Appalachian State University. I grew up in Wilmington, NC, where I developed a deep love for Mexican culture and Spanish, my favorite language. I enjoy fishing, spending time with friends, and learning through hands-on experiences, which help me connect theory with practice.

I started working at a young age, beginning in roofing, which taught me the value of hard work and perseverance. These experiences have shaped who I am today and inspire me to keep growing personally and professionally.
